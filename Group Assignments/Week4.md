# Week 4 Mini Group Assignment

After running into some issues regarding the (un)available data we had been working around, we decided to change tack and start again.

## Project Proposal

### Piped Dreams: Mapping School Expulsions and Oil Spills in Los Angeles
The concept of the “school-to-prison pipeline” describes how Black and brown students are sabotaged by systems that channel them away from education and into incarceration.  The image of the pipeline evokes problems passed along rather than addressed; it also reminds us of how labor is commodified under racial capitalism, in which incarcerated people work for slave wages.

When students are expelled, the state effectively deems them a loss, the wasted byproducts of schooling unworthy of further investment.  Students who have been expelled are far more likely to be incarcerated than the population at large, and so their removal from the system creates terrible externalities for their communities who must bear the social burden the state abandons.

Energy companies that extract and transport oil through urban population centers also impose burdens on the communities hosting their dirty infrastructure.  When oil spills occur, the environmental destruction that follows can represent a mere externality to the corporation but a matter of life and death for the places the oil wreaks havoc.

In mapping [school expulsions] (https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesed.asp) and [oil spills] (https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/distribution-transmission-gathering-lng-and-liquid-accident-and-incident-data) in Los Angeles, we will challenge the view of students as an expendable resource to be allocated by a racist sorting system.  Simultaneously, we will explore the social geography of oil production, noting who bears the burden of this environmentally destructive practice.  To the extent that both pollution and dysfunctional schools are comorbidities of structural racism, we expect to find that certain areas disproportionately host both, while others suffer from neither.

## Roles
We are eyeing 2 datasets and are planning to divide the responsibilities for leading the mapping and analysis between the two of us by dataset:
* Jeremy - School Data Czar
* Lillian - Oil Map Master

## Status update
### What’s working
Despite the change in direction, we are feeling optimistic and morale is good - between the two of us, we are committed to working on a project that we’re both excited about. 
### What’s not working
We have been spending a significant amount of time figuring out that our initial direction was a dead end and redefining the direction of the project. There has been minimal focus on the coding & substance of the work thus far. Ideally going forward we can engage with the coding assignments earlier in the week. During this second iteration of project design, we let available data that we found “lead the way” rather than having a research question and searching for data to support it. Hopefully with this method we are minimizing our odds of reaching another dead end.

## Data update
We will rely on [Cal DOE data] (https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesed.asp) breaking down expulsion statistics by school, and [US Department of Transportation data] (https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/distribution-transmission-gathering-lng-and-liquid-accident-and-incident-data)covering oil spills in LA county.
We will also incorporate racial and socioeconomic  census data to analyze how different communities are affected by environmental and educational dysfunction.

## Concerns 
### Major concerns
* Finding the appropriate data within our datasets - selecting schools or districts based on what is sufficiently descriptive while also being manageable; filtering for types of schools
* Geolocating the data (especially for schools and/or districts)
* What type of data analysis are we going to do? Regression analysis? What are the metrics we are using?

### Minor concerns
* Being able to present the data clearly and aesthetically
