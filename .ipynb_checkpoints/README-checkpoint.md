# Piped Dreams: Mapping School Expulsions and Oil Spills in Los Angeles

The concept of the “school-to-prison pipeline” describes how Black and brown students are sabotaged by systems that channel them away from education and into incarceration.  The image of the pipeline evokes problems passed along rather than addressed; it also reminds us of how labor is commodified under racial capitalism, in which incarcerated people work for slave wages.

When students are expelled, the state effectively deems them a loss, the wasted byproducts of schooling unworthy of further investment.  Students who have been expelled are far more likely to be incarcerated than the population at large, and so their removal from the system creates terrible externalities for their communities who must bear the social burden the state abandons.

Energy companies that extract and transport oil through urban population centers also impose burdens on the communities hosting their dirty infrastructure.  When oil spills occur, the environmental destruction that follows can represent a mere externality to the corporation but a matter of life and death for the places the oil wreaks havoc.

In mapping school expulsions and oil spills in Los Angeles, we will challenge the view of students as an expendable resource to be allocated by a racist sorting system.  Simultaneously, we will explore the social geography of oil production, noting who bears the burden of this environmentally destructive practice.  To the extent that both pollution and dysfunctional schools are comorbidities of structural racism, we expect to find that certain areas disproportionately host both, while others suffer from neither.
